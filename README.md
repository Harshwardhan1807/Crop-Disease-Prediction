# Crop-Disease-Prediction
### This Crop Disease Prediction project is a web application built using Flask and TensorFlow. It allows users to upload images of crop leaves and predicts Potato, Tomato or Pepper diseases or if it is healthy based on a deep learning model built using CNN trained on over 22,000 images from a Kaggle dataset. The results, including predicted disease and confidence, are displayed along with the uploaded image.
